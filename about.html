   <h2>Website Notes:</h2>
   <br><br>
   <h3>Website Purpose</h3>
   <br>
   <p>This website was created by Matthew Adlam with the purpose of informing the public on attractions and things to do, (and getting excellence on my internal). This website has all the required parameters to get excellence, where also being informative, well styled and verified by CSS and HTML checkers. It suggests information on the pages and links the websites to the articles.</p>
    <br><br>
    <h3>Colour Palette</h3>
    <br>
    <p>We made the colour palette work for many purposes. The theme is the BOP, which is a sunny place with a lot of water, so it was necessary to use an excess of yellows and blues, and it looks asthetically pleasing. I have tested my images on a colour blindness simulator, and it does not make many changes to the outcome of this website.</p>

   <h3>Usability and Accessibility</h3>
   <br>
   <p>All of this website was tested on multiple browsers and devices by multiple people and it has been deemed accessible and easy to use. </p>
     <p>The overall content of this website is not affected by the colour scheme, although it works nicely with it, so visually impared people can understand it without missing too many key details. </p>
     <p>I have a popup dialogue for when someone wants to leave the page.</p>
   <p>The site is practical and easy to navigate.</p>
