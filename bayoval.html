      <li>The Bay Oval is Tauranga's international cricket ground. It is used for several New Zealand matches and was a premier ground in the Under 19 World Cup.</li> 
      <li>The Bay Oval Trust is a Charitable Trust constituted in 2009 by the Bay of Plenty Cricket Association.  The purpose of the Bay Oval Trust is to enable and encourage the community to play cricket or other games and sports thereby assisting in the physical health and well being of the Bay of Plenty community.  View all purposes here.

        Trustees of the Bay Oval Trust have always determined that the Bay Oval will be a ground that is accessable to all cricketers in our community from junior through to international, as well as a ground that compliments Blake Park in the provision of facilities for multiple sporting codes and community groups.
        
        The Bay Oval, situated on Blake Park, Mount Maunganui, is the premier cricket ground of the Bay of Plenty Region.   Set against the backdrop of Mount Mauao, the Bay Oval is an internationally sized, purpose built ground.  It boasts 70 m boundaries, enclosed by a white picket fence, surrounded by grass embankments with seating for up to 10,000 people.   The Bay Oval boasts an 18-strip grass practice facility, unique in quality and availability; able to be used throughout the year, due to the exceptional climate of the BOP, and the free draining surrounds.
        
        The Oval is now complimented by the Carrus Pavilion, which features international standard changing and player viewing facilities.  In 2014 further development saw the construction of a media tower/sight screen providing state of the art facilities for television and radio broadcasts.
        
        The Bay Oval is becoming New Zealandâ€™s preferred pre-season training facility, hosting a number of First Class teams as well as internationals including Afghanistan and South Africa, the Black Caps and White Ferns.</li> 
      <li>These days, the Bay Oval hosts international teams regulary and now boasts 6 lights, instead of the usual 4, enabling night matches.</li>
