    <h3>Mount Maunganui</h3>
    <br>
    <br>
    <ul>
    <li> The Mount Maunganui Beach is one of the best beaches in the world. Tourists flock here every year to enjoy the sand, surf and sun. It also has an award-winning lifeguard service. </li>
      <li>This is the ultimate spot to swim, surf and sunbathe and this glorious stretch of golden sand has been voted the best beach in the country.

      In fact, visitors have also ranked it the second best beach in the South Pacific and among the top 25 beaches in the world according to Trip Advisor.
      
      You’ll find thousands of beachgoers every day here in summer but there’s more than enough room for you to spread out on the sizzling sand and enjoy a dip in the warm ocean waves.
      
      Sea temperatures can reach 21°C or more in summer so this is a popular place to swim. Conditions are generally safe but waves can occasionally be rough and rips can form. The Mount Maunganui surf lifeguards regularly patrol this beach so look for their flags to find the safest area to swim.</li>
      <li>This beach sits at the base of Mauao, Mt Maunganui’s iconic mountain, and runs for approximately 1km along to Moturiki (Leisure) Island.

      Moturiki is connected to the beach by a man-made land bridge and features a spectacular blowhole at the far end of the island which bursts into life during a large swell or high tide. It’s also a great place to enjoy panoramic ocean views and look back along the coastline. A well-formed walking track will lead you from the beach right to the very top and takes about 15 minutes.
      
      Moturiki Island is also the best place to fish in this area because the beach itself is usually too busy for surf-casting. You can catch snapper, kahawai and gurnard off the rocks here.
      
      Surfers and boogie boarders love the Main Beach and you’ll find hundreds of people riding waves of all sizes here. Sign up for a surf lesson and hire a board on the sand dunes beside the beach. Local surf instructors teach complete newbies through to experienced surfers who want a hand refining their technique. You can often find a good left-hand break off the northern (Mauao) end of the beach, or a good right-hand wave at the southern end.</li>
